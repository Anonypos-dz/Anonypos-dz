### *Self-Taught Hacker & Low-Level Developer*

---

## ⚡ What I Actually Do
- 👉 Break web applications, analyze how protections fail, and craft payloads that bypass them  
- 👉 Build custom tools (Python / C / JS) for automation, scanning, and exploitation  
- 👉 Study memory, pointers, buffer logic, and how programs behave at a low level  
- 👉 Reverse-engineer behaviors, debug binaries, and understand program flow  
- 👉 Create custom labs to test XSS filters, WordPress hardening, and WAF bypasses  
- 👉 Develop clean UIs and client-side logic when needed (players, dashboards, tools)

## 🧠 Strong Skills
• Advanced Web Hacking (XSS bypassing, filter evasion, payload crafting)
• WordPress pentesting & plugin analysis
• Memory understanding (stack / heap basics, pointers, buffers)
• Low-level programming in C (logic, sockets, struct manipulation)
• Python for automation, scraping, and tools
• Reverse-engineering mindset & debugging
• Building custom front-end interfaces for tools

## 🔥 Notable Projects
- **Advanced XSS Payload Collection** – custom bypasses for WordPress/WAF  
- **UTF-8 Fixer Tool** – Python utility to repair broken project encodings  
- **Custom Music Player** – full JS logic with animations & dynamic playlist  
- **C Socket Experiments** – low-level network code and memory tests  
- **Personal Pentest Labs** – real exploitation practice environments

## 🧩 What I Focus On
• Becoming fully independent as a hacker
• Mastering low-level logic
• Understanding systems deeply, not superficially
• Building real tools, not simple scripts

## 🐉 Signature
“I don’t stop until I understand exactly how it works — and why.”
